### Coding Assignment - 3 - Implementation of Wine Quality Prediction using Polynomial Regression

Hi Guys,

In this coding assignment you need to use the dataset provided to you in dataset folder and Implementation of Polynomial Regression using Polynomial Features with Linear Regression using gradient descent technique.

#### Problem:
The data you are given is the wine dataset. You need to implement Polynomial Regression model to estimate wine quality
of a given wine.

#### Dataset:
The dataset is about “wine” drink. Wine Quality is a measurable quantity. In this dataset, multiple chemical properties like acidity, citric acid etc are provided as input variables and wine quality for each wine is also recorded as an integer(1-10) 
For detailed information on the dataset and attributes you can visit the following link:

#### Submission Guidelines: 
You need to use the given directory structure and put the code you develop in the code folder. **You need to upload the final version to your github repository and share the url of your repository with me on facebook group for feedback and evaluation.**

#### Related Articles and documents:
All the relevant information regarding Polynomial Regression can be found in session - 14 which is now uploaded on Youtube.
Linear Regression implementation will be same as before.
