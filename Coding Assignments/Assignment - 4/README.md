### Coding Assignment - 4 - Implementation of KNN, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees from scratch for Mobile Price Classification

Hi Guys,

In this coding assignment you need to use the dataset provided to you in dataset folder and Implementation of KNN, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees from Scratch for Mobile Price Classification Problem.

#### Problem:
The data you are given is the Mobile Pricing category dataset. You need to implement KNN, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees from scratch to build that classificaton model.

#### Dataset:
The dataset is about Mobile Pricing. In this dataset, multiple characteristics of mobile phone are recorded like has_4g, memmory etc. Also price category of each mobile is recorded in 4 different classes.

**All characteristics recorded for Mobile:**

**X (or) Input Variables**
* battery_power: Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh
* blue: Has bluetooth or not
* clock_speed: speed at which microprocessor executes instructions
* dual_sim: Has dual sim support or not
* fc: Front Camera mega pixels
* four_g: Has 4G or not
* int_memory: Internal Memory in Gigabytes
* m_dep: Mobile Depth in cm
* mobile_wt: Weight of mobile phone
* n_cores: Number of cores of processor
* pc: Primary Camera mega pixels
* px_height: Pixel Resolution Height
* px_width: Pixel Resolution Width
* ram: Random Access Memory in Megabytes
* sc_h: Screen Height of mobile in cm
* sc_w: Screen Width of mobile in cm
* talk_time: longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are
* three_g: Has 3G or not
* touch_screen: Has touch screen or not
* wifi: Has wifi or not

**Y (or) Target Variable**
* priceRange: Price category

#### Submission Guidelines:
You need to use the given directory structure and put the code you develop in the code folder. **You need to upload the final version to your github repository and share the url of your repository with me on facebook group for feedback and evaluation.**

#### Related Articles and documents:
All the relevant information regarding KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees can be found in our previous sessions which is now uploaded on Youtube. Code for scratch implementation of KNN, Naive bayes and Decision trees for iris classification will be uploaded shortly on github. You can refer to that as well.
